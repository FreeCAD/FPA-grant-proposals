# FPA Grant Proposals
Submit grant proposals to the [The FreeCAD Project Association](https://fpa.freecad.org) by [creating an issue](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FPA-grant-proposals/issues/new/choose) in this repository. For more information see [The FreeCAD Grant Program](https://fpa.freecad.org/programs/fpadf-announcement).

Proposals will be considered by the FPA general body and approved by vote. A list of [approved grants](https://fpa.freecad.org/programs/fpadf-announcement) is available on the FPA's website.

## Reporting

In most cases grantees will submit periodic reports to the FPA detailing their work to date. Those reports are submitted as Pull Requests to the [FPA's main git repository](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FPA/tree/main/reports).
